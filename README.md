The goal is to provide insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, total pizzas sold, average order value, and more. The data includes sales, orders, and product performance for a pizza business across various dimensions like pizza categories, sizes, and time periods.

## Key Objectives
- **Analyze sales performance**: Understand sales trends, best-selling pizzas, and revenue distribution.
- **Track customer behavior**: Examine average order values, order patterns by day and month, and pizza preferences.
- **Identify best and worst sellers**: Highlight the pizzas that generate the highest and lowest revenues and order quantities.
- **Optimize business performance**: Provide actionable insights to improve sales and inventory decisions.

## Data Sources
The dataset includes the following information:
- **Total Revenue**: Overall sales in dollar amounts.
- **Total Orders**: Number of orders placed.
- **Average Order Value**: The average dollar value of each order.
- **Total Pizzas Sold**: The number of pizzas sold in different categories (Classic, Supreme, Chicken, Veggie).
- **Sales by Pizza Size**: Distribution of revenue by pizza sizes (Large, Medium, Regular, X-Large).
